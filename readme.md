## Branch "hw03-mongodb" - works with MongoDB and Mongoose:
1. Created a database with collection "contacts" and routers.
2. In the functions of processing requests, replaced the code of CRUD operations on contacts from a file with Mongoose methods for working with a collection of contacts in the database.
